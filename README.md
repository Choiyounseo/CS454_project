## What we implemented
DefenseGAN using **Genetic Algorithm(GA)**, instead of Gradient descent(GD)

## DEAP for GA
DEAP version == 1.3.0

## Related works : DefenseGAN
You can read DefenseGAN paper in here [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06605.pdf)

You can also see codes in github repository [link](https://github.com/kabkabm/defensegan)

## Result
#### Gradient Descent
| Type | Epsilon = 0.1 | Epsilon = 0.2 | Epsilon = 0.3 | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Classifier A | 88/100 | 93/100 | 89/100 | 90% |
| Classifier B | - | - | - | - |
| Classifier C | 79/100 | 87/100 | 86/100 | 84% |

#### Memetic Genetic Algorithm
| Type | Epsilon = 0.1 | Epsilon = 0.2 | Epsilon = 0.3 | Total |
